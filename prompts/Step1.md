Create a high-performance, vanilla JavaScript HTML page featuring an autonomous, interactive background. Use a fixed pixel grid where each cell changes color over time based on procedural noise (such as Perlin or Simplex noise) to introduce a controlled level of randomness and chaos. Enhance the design by ensuring that cursor interactions lead to more dramatic visual feedback, resulting in fluid, clustering color blobs that evoke a retro, pixel-art tech aesthetic.
