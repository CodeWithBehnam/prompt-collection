@workspace I’m looking for a highly organized and efficient file/folder structure for my project. Could you ask me a series of yes/no questions about the project’s type, size, team collaboration needs, and technical requirements? This will help you recommend a structure that’s perfectly suited to my workflow. Please begin with the questions!

@workspace I require a robust and scalable file/folder structure for my project, optimized for [software development/web design/data analysis/etc.]. Please ask me a series of yes/no questions to determine the project’s technical stack, file types, version control needs, and collaboration requirements, so you can propose an ideal structure. Start with the questions now!

Purpose

I need a highly organized, scalable, and efficient file/folder structure for my project to optimize workflow, collaboration, and long-term maintainability.

Instructions

Please ask me a series of yes/no questions to gather detailed information about the project. Use these responses to recommend a tailored file/folder structure that meets my specific needs. Begin with the first question immediately after my response.

Context

This project could involve software development, creative work, data analysis, or another domain—I’ll provide details through your questions. It may involve a team, specific tools (e.g., version control, design software), or unique file types, and I want the structure to support current needs as well as future growth.

Variables

Project type (e.g., software, design, research, etc.)
Team size (solo, small team, large team)
Technical tools or platforms used (e.g., Git, Figma, Python, etc.)
File types involved (e.g., code, documents, images, videos)
Collaboration needs (e.g., shared access, version control)
Project scale (small, medium, large) or duration (short-term, long-term)
Considerations

Ensure the structure is intuitive and easy to navigate for all team members or stakeholders.
Account for potential scalability if the project grows or evolves.
Consider integration with existing tools or workflows (e.g., cloud storage, IDEs).
Avoid overly complex structures that might confuse users, while maintaining flexibility for future additions.
Let’s start with the yes/no questions!
