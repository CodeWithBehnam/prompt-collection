@workspace I’m looking for a highly organized and efficient file/folder structure for my project. Could you ask me a series of yes/no questions about the project’s type, size, team collaboration needs, and technical requirements? This will help you recommend a structure that’s perfectly suited to my workflow. Please begin with the questions!

Purpose

I need a highly organized, scalable, and efficient file/folder structure for my project to optimize workflow, collaboration, and long-term maintainability.

Instructions

Please ask me a series of yes/no questions to gather detailed information about the project. Use these responses to recommend a tailored file/folder structure that meets my specific needs. Begin with the first question immediately after my response.

Context

This project could involve software development, creative work, data analysis, or another domain—I’ll provide details through your questions. It may involve a team, specific tools (e.g., version control, design software), or unique file types, and I want the structure to support current needs as well as future growth.

Variables

Project type (e.g., software, design, research, etc.)
Team size (solo, small team, large team)
Technical tools or platforms used (e.g., Git, Figma, Python, etc.)
File types involved (e.g., code, documents, images, videos)
Collaboration needs (e.g., shared access, version control)
Project scale (small, medium, large) or duration (short-term, long-term)
Considerations

Ensure the structure is intuitive and easy to navigate for all team members or stakeholders.
Account for potential scalability if the project grows or evolves.
Consider integration with existing tools or workflows (e.g., cloud storage, IDEs).
Avoid overly complex structures that might confuse users, while maintaining flexibility for future additions.

- Project type (e.g., software, design, research, etc.)

# @workspace

## Purpose
I need to understand and implement effective database (DB) connection logic for my project, ensuring reliability, performance, and maintainability, with a focus on the `file:db.ts` file.

## Instructions
Please provide a detailed explanation of a few different strategies I can use to implement this DB connection logic. For each strategy, include the pros and cons, and ensure the response is tailored to a TypeScript environment (as indicated by `file:db.ts`). If you need more specific details about my project or DB setup, ask yes/no questions to refine your recommendations. Start with your explanation now.

## Context
This project likely involves a TypeScript-based application, possibly a web or backend system, where database connectivity is critical. The `file:db.ts` suggests a focus on TypeScript-specific implementation, potentially using a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or SQLite. I may be working on a new feature, optimizing existing code, or building a scalable system, and I want strategies that balance simplicity, scalability, and performance.

## Variables
- Type of database (e.g., relational like PostgreSQL/MySQL, NoSQL like MongoDB, or file-based like SQLite)  
- Application type (e.g., web, mobile, backend API, etc.)  
- Scale of the application (small, medium, large)  
- Current tools or frameworks used (e.g., Node.js, Express, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)  
- Connection pooling or single-connection needs  
- Security or performance requirements (e.g., authentication, query optimization)  

## Considerations
- Ensure the strategies are compatible with TypeScript and maintain type safety.  
- Account for scalability if the application grows or handles more traffic.  
- Consider performance implications, such as connection overhead or latency.  
- Address security concerns, like preventing SQL injection or managing credentials.  
- Avoid overly complex solutions if the project is small or simple, while ensuring flexibility for future expansion.  
- Provide practical code examples or pseudocode for each strategy, if applicable.
